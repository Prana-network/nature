Different abnormal use of unusal data streams connections can cause th whole system to stabilze it's state and workflow mode.
This effect is caused by collection of special data as sets of dynamicaly got and measured parameters of system streams for compilation of 
calibration pattern.

Effectively influencing when being applied on globally connected system, pereodicaly,
in sets of several passes and fixed quantity of iterations. 

Named Pranayam instrumentarium.

=================================================
Examples: 

artificially stress test the client data stream average bandwidth by linking the verbose network monitoring data stream 
to render as content in all user interfaces.

or 

making prediction of average program audience by linking statistics constant data and closed similar type of elder
program already been succesfully implemented.
